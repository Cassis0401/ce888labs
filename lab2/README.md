# myvehicles.py
This is the code about vehicles.csv,and Create histograms and scatterplots for "current fleet" and "proposed fleet". 
I use the function from python to get the values for mean, median, var,std and MAD.

Mean: 30.481013
Median: 32.000000
Var: 36.831918
Std: 6.068931
MAD: 4.000000

I use the fuction called dropna() to remove the nan.
